# RISC Processor Module Implementation Guidelines

This document outlines the implementation requirements for each module in the RISC processor.

## Program Counter (PC)
- 5-bit register that tracks the current instruction address
- Must activate at the rising edge of the clock
- Requires active-HIGH reset signal to return PC to 0
- Must support loading an arbitrary value for jumps
- Otherwise increments sequentially

## Address MUX
- Multiplexes between instruction address and operand address
- Default width should be 5 bits (parameterized for reusability)
- sel=1 selects instruction address (PC output)
- sel=0 selects operand address (from instruction)

## Memory
- Single shared memory for instructions and data
- Single bidirectional data port (can't read and write simultaneously)
- 5-bit address width (32 addresses)
- 8-bit data width
- Synchronous operation on the positive clock edge
- Supports read and write operations

## Instruction Register (IR)
- 8-bit register to hold the current instruction
- Upper 3 bits are opcode, lower 5 bits are operand address
- Loads new instruction when ld_ir is active
- Synchronous operation

## Accumulator Register (ACC)
- 8-bit register that stores intermediate results
- Loads result from ALU when ld_ac is active
- Synchronous operation
- Used as first operand for most ALU operations

## ALU
- Performs 8 operations on 8-bit operands (inA and inB)
- Operations defined by 3-bit opcode:
  - 000 (HLT): Halt program, output inA
  - 001 (SKZ): Check if inA is zero, output inA
  - 010 (ADD): Add inA and inB, output result
  - 011 (AND): Logical AND of inA and inB, output result
  - 100 (XOR): Logical XOR of inA and inB, output result
  - 101 (LDA): Output inB (load from memory)
  - 110 (STO): Output inA (store to memory)
  - 111 (JMP): Unconditional jump, output inA
- Asynchronous is_zero flag that indicates if inA is zero

## Controller
- 8-state state machine with the following states:
  - INST_ADDR
  - INST_FETCH
  - INST_LOAD
  - IDLE
  - OP_ADDR
  - OP_FETCH
  - ALU_OP
  - STORE
- Reset state is INST_ADDR
- Synchronous operation on the positive clock edge
- Takes 3-bit opcode input
- Generates the following control signals:
  - sel (address select)
  - rd (memory read)
  - ld_ir (load instruction register)
  - halt (processor halt)
  - inc_pc (increment program counter)
  - ld_ac (load accumulator)
  - ld_pc (load program counter)
  - wr (memory write)
  - data_e (data enable)
- Control signals depend on current state and opcode
